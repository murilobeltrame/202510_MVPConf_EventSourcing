# Event Sourcing

## Benefits of event sourcing

| Benefit | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Complete, immutable audit log | Provides a perfect and intrinsic audit trail, as every state-changing event is recorded in an immutable, append-only log. This is crucial for compliance in regulated industries. |
| Temporal capabilities ("time travel") | Enables the reconstruction of the application's state at any point in time by replaying events. This is invaluable for debugging, historical analysis, and "what-if" scenarios. |
| Enhanced scalability for writes | Simplifies and optimizes write operations, as the system only needs to append new events to a log. This is a highly performant, low-contention process suitable for applications with high concurrent write loads. |
| Resilience and fault tolerance | Read models (projections) can be fully rebuilt from the event stream if they become corrupted or are lost, ensuring robust data recovery. |
| Decoupling and architectural flexibility | Events serve as a communication mechanism between services, allowing for a loosely coupled, event-driven architecture. This is a natural fit for microservices. |
| Improved business insight | The event log preserves the rich business context of state changes, providing a comprehensive dataset for advanced analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning. |
| Simplified complex workflows | It is easier to implement robust complex workflows, and features like "undo/redo," since the entire history of actions is recorded. |

## Pitfalls and challenges of event sourcing

| Pitfall | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Significant complexity and learning curve | This pattern requires developers to master new concepts like aggregates, projections, snapshots, and event versioning. The initial learning curve and development overhead can be substantial. |
| Eventual consistency | When used with the CQRS pattern, read models are eventually consistent, meaning there is a delay between a write and when it is reflected in the query side. This must be managed for applications that require immediate read-after-write consistency. |
| Data management and storage | The append-only event log can grow indefinitely, leading to potentially significant storage requirements. This necessitates strategies for managing log size, such as creating snapshots and archiving old events. |
| Event schema versioning | Changes to event schemas over time require a versioning strategy (e.g., event upcasting) to ensure that the system can correctly process both old and new events. |
| Data privacy (GDPR) compliance | The immutable nature of the event log conflicts with regulations like GDPR that require the "right to be forgotten." Compliant solutions for deleting personal data add a layer of complexity. |
| Querying data | The event log is not optimized for ad-hoc queries. This necessitates building and managing separate read models (projections) that are updated from the event stream. |
| State rehydration performance | For entities with a long history, re-creating the current state by replaying all events can be slow. Snapshots are used to mitigate this, but they add system complexity. |
| Concurrency control | While appending events avoids locking, it requires implementing an optimistic concurrency control scheme (e.g., using version numbers) to handle conflicting updates to the same entity. |
